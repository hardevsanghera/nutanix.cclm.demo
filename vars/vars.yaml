#### These Ansible playbooks and associated variables assume 2x RX HPOC clusters with the associated RX IP/password scheme.
#### Further, the cluster should have a stretch vlan enabled between them.
#### Two clusters: cluster_A and cluster_B will be managed by a single PC.
#### cluster_A will be the Primary (aka the source cluster) and cluster_B will be the secondary (aka the failover target cluster)
#### VM(s) can be failed over from cluster_A to cluster_B while maintaining the same IP address thanks to synchronous data replication
#### between cluster_A and cluster_B as well as the stretch vlan between the two clusters a VM can be live migrated A -> B and once
#### data sync has settled the VM can be live migrated B -> A.
